refresh-model-catalog.py — keep the shared model catalog current.

Single source of truth: /opt/agents/shared-config/models-providers.json
Included by each peer's ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json via
  "models": { "providers": { "$include": "./models-providers.json" } }

OpenClaw's $include security check REJECTS hardlinks and files outside the
user's home, so the shared catalog CANNOT be hard/sym-linked into peer homes.
We keep one authoritative copy in /opt and COPY it (regular file, owned by the
peer, mode 600) into each peer's ~/.openclaw/ on every run.

Data sources:
  1. PUBLIC OpenRouter /models endpoint (no API key) — carries anthropic/*,
     openai/*, x-ai/*, deepseek/* ids with pricing + context. Direct Anthropic
     entries (claude-opus-5) are derived from the same data.
  2. PROVIDER-DIRECT /models endpoints (OpenAI-compatible) for providers whose
     API key is present in the environment. This catches direct-only models that
     never appear on OpenRouter (e.g. moonshot/kimi-k3, moonshot-v1-*). Added
     2026-08-29 (nova-mind moonshot-gap) — the OpenRouter-only design silently
     missed 10 Moonshot models for months because it described what is MIRRORED,
     not what EXISTS.

VERIFICATION (added 2026-08-29): after every run, counts models per provider and
ALERTS (non-zero exit + stderr) when a provider drops to zero or below a floor,
or when a keyed provider could not be reached. A registry that is stale in a way
nobody notices is worse than one that is obviously broken.

Per GLOBAL/CRON_DESIGN: deterministic script owns the write. Additive + curated:
only ADDS newly-discovered models for the watched families; never deletes
hand-maintained entries. Validates JSON, backs up, atomic writes, validates each
peer config load.
